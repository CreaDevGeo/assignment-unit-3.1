      <h3>Hey there whoevere's taking a look at this!</h3>
      <p>I have a questions about some of the questions</p>
      <h3>Task</h3>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style: decimal; font-weight: bold;">4.g</li>
        <li style="list-style: circle;">For this task, I learned that the array .join method adds a string 
        to the array as well as changes the entire array to a string. I also learned the .split() method 
        changes the array back from a string. The problem with this though is that the array is now only one index. 
        How do I add objects to the ends of an array's elements without completely altering all elements? </li>
      </ul>
